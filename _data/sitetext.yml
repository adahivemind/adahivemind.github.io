    title: "Abstract"
    text: "A brief introduction to the project"
    body: "Every year, natural disasters happen and often take many lives. After such events, 
    the pages of newspapers are full of quotes from people expressing regret for the unfortunate 
    event. These events often remain in people's memory for a lifetime. What influences how long 
    these events will be talked about years later? In this research project, our goal is to explore 
    how much is said about the biggest disasters (such as earthquakes, storms, floods) years after 
    they have occurred and what factors influence this. We will look for answers in the 
    [Quotebank](https://github.com/epfl-dlab/Quotebank) 2008-2020 quotes on disasters taken from the
     [international disasters database](https://public.emdat.be/data) combined with world 
     development indicators from the [World Data Bank](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators). 
     To simplify disaster quote detection, we will further look into classifying the quotes by 
     whether they talk about a disaster or not."

    body1: "We proposed to explore two questions in this research project. 
    First, how correctly will NLP models trained on disaster tweets like in this kaggle challenge generalize to classifying disaster quotes in Quotebank? 
    This question is important in respect of robustness of models and raise the problem of training new models for different type of texts.
    Second, what factors influence how long a earthquake will be talked about in Quotebank quotes from 2008 to 2020? 
    The interesting factors can include total deaths, total damage in dollars, country of disaster, wealth indicators of the country, etc. 
    So, we analyse this question from the point of the disaster specific traits of the event, and from the location of the event."

      text: "Analysis of the media coverage of natural disasters in the Quotebank dataset"
      body1: "What makes an earthquake worth to talk about? 
      <br><br>
      All of the news portals are trying to find those events which reach the most readers. Natural 
      disasters are a topic that interests many readers. Naturally, people don’t want to lag behind 
      the world’s most important events, but that people are much more likely to read negative news 
      than positive news, also contributes to that news portals are happy to bring down articles 
      about these events. These tendencies are also true for celebrities, politicians and other 
      media influencers whose thoughts and ideas are quoted in the media.
      <br><br>
      As for other news as well, the number of quotes in total and in the first period after the 
      event is a meaningful indicator of its popularity in media. For the earthquakes we used this 
      measurement to analyse the appearance of the disaster in the news. We also included the 
      length between the first and last appearance of the earthquake in the quotes in the analysis, 
      which happened to be less meaningful in this respect."
      body2: "As we would expect, people tend to talk about more in the first few months after the 
      earthquake about the disaster. As for any news an event is interesting if it happened in the 
      recent past. For the earthquakes, one would expect that its appearance in the news is longer 
      that casual news, because of the post-earthquakes and the long time of recovery of an area. 
      In our analysis, we could also observe a peak of the daily quotes after one year of the date 
      of the event, this can be the result of the anniversary commemorations."
      body3: "However, our main focus was that what can influence the media coverage of the 
      earthquakes. To analyse this question we gathered a lot of data about the disaster itself and 
      its location and examined the correlation between these indicators and the media coverage 
      indicators. What we would expect that those factors which measures the human exposure.
      
      <br><br>
      As it can be seen in the heatmap, we observed a massive correlation between the number of quotes and
      
      - the number of death associated with the event
      
      - the number of injured
      
      - the reconstruction cost
      
      
      As for the number of quotes in the first year the list expanded by 
      
      - aid contribution
      
      - mortality rate between under 5 years olds
      
      - number of days required to start a business"
