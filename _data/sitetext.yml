    title: "Abstract"
    text: "A brief introduction to the project"
    body: "Every year, natural disasters happen and often take many lives. After such events, 
    the pages of newspapers are full of quotes from people expressing regret for the unfortunate 
    event. These events often remain in people's memory for a lifetime. What influences how long 
    these events will be talked about years later? In this research project, our goal is to explore 
    how much is said about the biggest disasters (such as earthquakes, storms, floods) years after 
    they have occurred and what factors influence this. We will look for answers in the 
    [Quotebank](https://github.com/epfl-dlab/Quotebank) 2008-2020 quotes on disasters taken from the
     [international disasters database](https://public.emdat.be/data) combined with world 
     development indicators from the [World Data Bank](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators). 
     To simplify disaster quote detection, we will further look into classifying the quotes by 
     whether they talk about a disaster or not."

    body1: "We proposed to explore two questions in this research project. 
    First, how correctly will NLP models trained on disaster tweets like in this kaggle challenge generalize to classifying disaster quotes in Quotebank? 
    This question is important in respect of robustness of models and raise the problem of training new models for different type of texts.
    Second, what factors influence how long a earthquake will be talked about in Quotebank quotes from 2008 to 2020? 
    The interesting factors can include total deaths, total damage in dollars, country of disaster, wealth indicators of the country, etc. 
    So, we analyse this question from the point of the disaster specific traits of the event, and from the location of the event."
