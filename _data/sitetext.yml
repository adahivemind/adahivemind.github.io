    title: "Abstract"
    text: "A brief introduction to the project"
    body: "Every year, natural disasters happen and often take many lives. After such events, 
    the pages of newspapers are full of quotes from people expressing regret for the unfortunate 
    event. These events often remain in people's memory for a lifetime. What influences how long 
    these events will be talked about years later? In this research project, our goal is to explore 
    how much is said about the biggest disasters (such as earthquakes, storms, floods) years after 
    they have occurred and what factors influence this. We will look for answers in the 
    [Quotebank](https://github.com/epfl-dlab/Quotebank) 2008-2020 quotes on disasters taken from the
     [international disasters database](https://public.emdat.be/data) combined with world 
     development indicators from the [World Data Bank](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators). 
     To simplify disaster quote detection, we will further look into classifying the quotes by 
     whether they talk about a disaster or not."

    title: "Research Questions"
    text: "Questions tackled in the research"
    body: "In this research project, we explore two questions.
    First, how correctly will NLP models trained on disaster tweets like in 
    [this kaggle challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/overview) generalize to 
    classifying disaster quotes in Quotebank? This question is important in respect of robustness 
    analysis of models and their transfer learning capabilities.
    Second, what factors influence how long a earthquake will be talked about in Quotebank quotes 
    from 2008 to 2020? The interesting factors include total deaths, total damage in dollars, 
    country of disaster, wealth indicators of the country, etc. 
    There are various other research question related to this that are interesting and worth 
    further research, like \"what is the sentiment towards different disasters and why\" and \"how 
    does the country of the speaker affect which disasters he is talking about\"."

          they were found, we cannot find out the true geographical location of the news source 
          from the link itself. E.g. theguardian.com and nytimes.com both use .com top-level domain, 
          but they are reporting events in different countries. That's why we decided to choose a 
          GDELT dataset that associates a particular domain with the right country from which that 
          news source comes. This dataset was created from the enormous GDELT dataset and used the 
          fact that news outlets cover events physically proximate to them far more often than they 
          do events on the other side of the world."

          In this dataset we have a collection of tweets about natural disasters and random topics
          from Twitter users. The tweets are labeled whether they are about a natural disaster or not.
          We are asked to classify whether the tweets are about natural disasters or not using NLP
          models. The structure of the dataset is as follows:
          <br><br>
          Columns<br>
          &emsp;`id` - a unique identifier for each tweet<br>
          &emsp;`text` - the text of the tweet<br>
          &emsp;`location` - the location the tweet was sent from (may be blank)<br>
          &emsp;`keyword` - a particular keyword from the tweet (may be blank)<br>
          &emsp;`target` - in train.csv only, this denotes whether a tweet is about a real disaster (1) or not (0)<br>
