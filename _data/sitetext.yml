    body: "Every year, natural disasters happen and often take many lives. After such events, 
    the pages of newspapers are full of quotes from people expressing regret for the unfortunate 
    event. These events often remain in people's memory for a lifetime. What influences how long 
    these events will be talked about years later? In this research project, our goal is to explore 
    how much is said about the biggest disasters (such as earthquakes, storms, floods) years after 
    they have occurred and what factors influence this. We will look for answers in the 
    [Quotebank](https://github.com/epfl-dlab/Quotebank) 2008-2020 quotes on disasters taken from the
     [international disasters database](https://public.emdat.be/data) combined with world 
     development indicators from the [World Data Bank](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators). 
     To simplify disaster quote detection, we will further look into classifying the quotes by 
     whether they talk about a disaster or not."

          <br><br>
          In this dataset we have a collection of tweets about natural disasters and random topics
          from Twitter users. The tweets are labeled whether they are about a natural disaster or not.
          We are asked to classify whether the tweets are about natural disasters or not using NLP
          models. The structure of the dataset is as follows:
          <br><br>
          Columns<br>
          &emsp;`id` - a unique identifier for each tweet<br>
          &emsp;`text` - the text of the tweet<br>
          &emsp;`location` - the location the tweet was sent from (may be blank)<br>
          &emsp;`keyword` - a particular keyword from the tweet (may be blank)<br>
          &emsp;`target` - in train.csv only, this denotes whether a tweet is about a real disaster (1) or not (0)<br>
